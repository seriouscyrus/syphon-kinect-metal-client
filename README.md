# syphon-kinect-metal-client
Syphon client for use with Kinect2 inputs from Delicode NI Mate (https://ni-mate.com), to render a point cloud from the encoded depth syphon stream.

A simple implementation of syphon in metal and swift for MacOS

WIP.

Syphon was built from https://github.com/anome/Syphon-Framework.git who have made some modifications to support Metal. If you have issues with signing, download the project and rebuild the framework with your own signing, then replace the one in this project.
